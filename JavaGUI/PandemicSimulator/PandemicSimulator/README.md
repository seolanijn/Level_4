<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>The science of
epidemiology is defined as "<i>the branch of medicine which deals with the
incidence, distribution, and possible control of diseases and other factors
relating to health</i>" (from the Oxford English dictionary online edition).</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>The difference between
an epidemic and a pandemic is one of geographical scale. An epidemic typically
is an outbreak of a disease that is localized to one geographic area. A
pandemic consists of multiple outbreaks of the disease spread over several
continents. The age of international air travel has made it much easier for a
disease to transition from a local epidemic into a worldwide pandemic in a very
short time. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>As computing technology
has advanced over the past fifty years, computer programs designed to model the
spread of diseases through a population have become important tools in attempts
to control epidemics and pandemics of contagious diseases. Pandemic simulations
based on how a disease is transmitted can help medical authorities recommend
various counter-measures such as wearing masks, physical distance rules, and
whether certain activities in a society (such as attending school classes, or
going to restaurants or concerts) should be limited or even stopped completely.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>Such simulation
software has been used by the government medical authorities in Ontario to
advise the government on their response to the current COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:Consolas'>Your
Mission:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>You task is to build a
GUI application that will allow the user to input certain parameters about a
population in terms of how many people are vaccinated or unvaccinated, and then
run a simulation to see how quickly a disease will spread through a population
of a given size. The application will simulate a period of three weeks in which
there will be one infected person in the population at the start of the
simulation. Then, this infected person will interact with the rest of the
population and we will be able to see how the disease can spread, based on
certain assumptions about the level of protection against the disease in the
rest of the population ( i.e.from being vaccinated, or from having already had
the disease and thereby acquiring some natural immunity, although with the recent
Omicron variants and sub-variants, even getting the disease once does not
guarantee that you won"t be re-infected.).</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>NOTE: the mathematics
behind pandemic simulation software can actually be quite complex, but we are
going to be using fairly simple assumptions related to how probable it is that
one individual could contract the disease from an infected individual. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>ON the next page are
some screen shots from an early prototype. </span></p>

<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Consolas'><br clear=all
style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Consolas'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>The first screen shot
shows the start of the simulation with just one infected person (the red dot)
in a population of 600 uninfected (the blue dots) people. As the simulation
progresses, the dots will all move about the screen randomly by distances of up
to 5 pixels.</span></p>

![Cycle 0](.misc/readme_resources/Picture1.png "All Blue dots")

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>This next screen shot
shows the situation after about 150 cycles of the simulation, which is about 30
seconds later, based on a Timer object lag time interval of 200 milliseconds,
which means the screen gets redrawn about 5 times per second.</span></p>

![Cycle 150](.misc/readme_resources/Picture2.png "Some infected, some recovered")

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>On this screen, the red
dots are infected persons. The blue dots are uninfected persons. The green dots
are infected persons who have recovered from the disease after about <span
style='color:red'>150</span> cycles, and are no longer infectious. Not seen on
this screen are any black dots, which indicate an infected person has died from
the disease. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>As the simulation runs,
collisions will occur between the moving dots. If an infected dot collides with
an uninfected, unvaccinated person, then in our simulation there is an 80%
chance that the uninfected person will become infected and also start spreading
the disease. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Consolas'>The Details</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>In the simulation, a
person infected status can either be true(infected) or false(not infected). On
the screen shots a red dot represents an infected person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>A person"s <b>immunity
status</b> can be in one of several different states, which are mutually
exclusive. <br>
<br>
1) a person is not vaccinated, and has not had the disease and therefore has no
immunity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>2) a person has had only
one shot of a two dose vaccine and has mild immunity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>3) a person has had
both shots of a two dose vaccine and has moderate immunity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>3) a person has had a
third booster shoot and has good immunity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>4) a person has had the
disease and has recovered, so that they have mild "natural immunity".</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>Now, even if a person
has had three doses of the vaccine or have acquired natural immunity, they
could still contract the disease and become spreaders, although the probability
of this happening will be lower than for any unvaccinated persons, as will be
detailed in the next section. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Consolas'>Probabilities of Getting Infected</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>As this is the summer
of 2022, we are going to assume that the dominant strain of the disease
circulating is the omicron strain and its sub-variants such as Ba-4 and Ba-5.
These variants have mutated somewhat from the original COVID-19 virus and are
better able to evade the immunity offered by the current vaccines in use. So, the
probability rules that we"ll use in this simulation for possible transmission
from an infected person to an uninfected person are based on a person"s
immunity status as follows:<br>
<br>
1) No immunity: If an infected person collides with an uninfected person who
has no immunity, then there is an 80% chance that the disease will be passed on
to the uninfected person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>2) One shot of vaccine:
If an infected person collides with an uninfected person who has had ONE shot
of the vaccine, then there is a 60% chance that the disease will be passed on
to the uninfected person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>3) Two shots of
vaccine: If an infected person collides with an uninfected person who has had
BOTH shots of the vaccine, then there is a 30% chance that the disease will be
passed on to the uninfected person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>4) Third booster shot
of vaccine: If an infected person collides with an uninfected person who has
had a third booster shot of the vaccine, then there is a 10% chance that the disease
will be passed on to the uninfected person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>5) If an infected
person collides with a person <i>who has had the disease and recovered and has
some mild natural immunity</i> (a green dot on the screen shot) then there is a
40% chance that the this person with mild natural immunity will be infected. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Consolas;color:red'>SERVICE PACK DETAILS:<br>
</span><span style='font-family:Consolas;color:red'>Question: what if a person
already had one or more shots, contracted the disease, and then
recovered...what is their level of immunity after they&nbsp; recover?&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Consolas;color:red'>OK, simplest solution here is
this...if the&nbsp; recovered person had not had any vaccinations at all before
they were infected, then assign them natural immunity status so they have a 40%
chance of re-infection.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Consolas;color:red'>If the person had just one
vaccination, then they originally had a 60% chance of infection. So, after
recovery, we should adjust their immunity to natural immunity status to a 40%
chance of re-infection, as this is an improvement over just one-shot
vaccination status.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Consolas;color:red'>For all other cases of
vaccination status where they have had the second and third shot,&nbsp;just leave
their status at the same immunity level&nbsp; that they had, because two-shot
and three-shot immunity it is better than the natural immunity level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Consolas'>What You Need to Do to Get
Started</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Consolas'>:</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>You need to write a
Person class that you can use to create an array of Person objects, which can
be drawn as colored dots on the screen. Rather than give you a specific UML
diagram for this, I am going to leave the class design up to you, but here are
a few hints to help you along the way. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>Some data members that you
might want to include in the class would be: </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><span style='font-family:Consolas'>-isAlive (boolean)</span></b><span
style='font-family:Consolas'>: if the object is alive it can move and can be
infected. If it is dead, it turns black and stops moving </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><span style='font-family:Consolas'>-isInfected(boolean)</span></b><span
style='font-family:Consolas'> : set this to true if the object gets infected by
another person object.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><span style='font-family:Consolas'>-immunityStatus(int)</span></b><span
style='font-family:Consolas'>: an int value that can range from 1 to 5 based on
the descriptions noted above. This determines the likelihood of an uninfected
object becoming infected if they collide with an infected object. The number of
person objects in each immunity state will be determined by an input by the
user of the program. For example if the user wants to run a simulation in which
nobody has any immunity, then they would enter this into the program before
running the simulation and specify that everyone in the population has no immunity.
Alternatively, the user may want to specify that 20% of the population has one
shot immunity, 40% has 2-shot immunity, 10% has natural immunity, and the
remaining 30% has no immunity. You will have to figure out how to create an
array of Persons with this distribution. Also, when the user enters the
immunity values, you will have to do some data validation to ensure that the
percentages add up to 100%.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><span style='font-family:Consolas'>-color(Color):</span></b><span
style='font-family:Consolas'> used to determine what color will be used when
the object is rendered to the screen. The graphics object g should use this
value to draw the object on the screen. You can color-code your objects using
the suggested following color scheme:</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>For infected objects,
RED is the obvious color to use.<br>
For dead objects, BLACK is the obvious color to use.<br>
<br>
For uninfected objects, you could use different colors to represent different
levels of immunity. <br>
For objects with no immunity, you could use BLUE. <br>
For objects with one shot immunity, you could use CYAN.<br>
For objects with two shot immunity, you could use YELLOW<br>
For objects with three shot immunity you could use MAGENTA.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>For infected objects
that have recovered, GREEN can be used to signify their status as having mild
natural immunity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>NOTE: one of the things
you should add to your visual display is a legend to indicate what each color
represents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><span style='font-family:Consolas'>-xCoordinate(int)
and yCoordinate(int):</span></b><span style='font-family:Consolas'> these will
hold the position where the object will be drawn on the drawing panel. These
are randomly generated when the object is instantiated. "At instantiation time
these values should be randomly generated and assigned so that a particular
Person object could be drawn anywhere on the drawing surface. You should ensure
that the values are within a range so that a person object will not be placed
outside of the drawing surface of your JPanel. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><span style='font-family:Consolas'>-xIncrementValue(int)
and yIncrementValue(int):</span></b><span style='font-family:Consolas'> these
represent the number of pixels that the object will "move" in each drawing
cycle. The value of each can range from -5 to +5 pixels.. These values will also
be randomly modified <i>if the object collides with another object</i> so that
the objects will probably change direction after the collision. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><span style='font-family:Consolas'>-cycleCounter(int)</span></b><span
style='font-family:Consolas'> : this is used to determine how long an infected
object remains infections. It starts at zero and <b>only starts</b> <b>incrementing
</b>when the object"s infected status changes to true. One of the assumptions
we"ll use in our model is that an infected person will be infectious for a
maximum of 7 days, so we"ll arbitrarily set the end of the infectious stage at
a count as 150 cycles, at which an infected person"s status will change to
green, if they have not died first. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>NOTE: you are not
limited to the data members listed above. If you can think of other data
members that you might find useful, you can add them in, but be sure to
document WHY and WHAT the new variables will be used to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>All the data members
should be private, and you should provide whatever getters and setters you
think are necessary. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><span style='font-family:Consolas'>Methods to Consider:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>You will need at least
one constructor method, but you can have more if you think you need them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>You will need a <b>move()</b>
method to calculate the new positions for each object for each drawing cycle. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>Also, you will need a <b>checkCollision()</b>
method to check to see if a collision has occurred between two objects. If it
has, you will need some code to determine what state variables should be
changed for the objects involved. Two variables that should be <i>randomly changed
for both objects involved in a collision are the xIncrementValue and the yIncrementValue</i>
so that the objects will have their direction of travel altered randomly.
Remember that these two values should range from -5 to +5. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><span style='font-family:Consolas'>You can add any
other methods as required</span></b><span style='font-family:Consolas'> to
accomplish whatever functions you need to do, but make sure the methods are
COMPLETELY DOCUMENTED so I know what the logic is doing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><span style='font-family:Consolas'>Probability of Death
From Infection.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><span style='font-family:Consolas'>You also need</span></b><span
style='font-family:Consolas'> to determine if any infected dots live or die. "ONLY
AFTER an infected object has stopped being infectious (150 cycles from when it
got infected), there is a probablility that the infected dot will die,

A one shot vaccinated person has a 7% chance of dying.<br>
A two shot vaccinated person has a 3% chance of dying.<br>
A three shot vaccinated person has a 1% chance of dying.<br>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><span style='font-family:Consolas'>Duration of the

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>To make the simulation
run in a reasonable amount of time, we can make the following assumptions:</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>1) our lag time between
screen repaints should be set to about 200 milliseconds. You can vary this up
and down a bit if you feel that you need to, but 200 milliseconds seems to give
a good visual display. This will result in the screen being repainted about 5
times per second. So, we will get about 300 repaint cycles in one minute of
running time. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>2) We would like the
simulation to represent a 21 day period. We will arbitrarily say that 150 repaint
cycles will represent 7 calendar days, so a complete simulation of 450 cycles
would represent a 21 day period. So we will set the number of repaint cycles to
be done to around 450. This means so that one run of the simulation will take
about 90 seconds and will represent a 21 day period. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'><b><span

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Consolas'>Before the simulation
